## Welcome to Matt's Page

Hey everyone. I'm Matthew Hickey, a senior Computer Engineering student at Memorial University of Newfoundland (Class of '21). This page is the place where I display any projects that I'm working on, and some of my past work. Feel free to take a look.

### [Resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_g9BEQCJlDbYkZpbEJ4SEJYWnM)

### Live Apps
* [Darts Scoreboard](https://mhickey.ca/darts-scoreboard-web)

### Projects/Work

* [React Native Darts Scoreboard](https://github.com/matthickey709/darts-scoreboard-web). This scoreboard is the sequel to the original [Java version](https://github.com/matthickey709/DartsScoreboard), but written in React instead. It can currently score games of 501, 301, and Around the World, with more (Baseball, Cricket) game modes coming soon.

* [uomi Android Application](https://github.com/hickeyjohnson/uomi_application) and [uomi REST API](https://github.com/hickeyjohnson/uomi_api). These projects were completed as part of my degree's junior design project alongside [Nathaniel Johnson](https://github.com/nathaniel19). It is an app where friends can track money owed either to each other, or as groups. The REST API was written with Flask, using Swagger as the documentation generator.

* [**Report**: Computer Architecture of Wearable Technology](https://github.com/matthickey709/WearablesReport/blob/master/FullReport.pdf). This report was written as the final assignment for the Computer Architecture course of my engineering degree. It focuses on smartwatches and virtual reality headsets, and how their architecture was chosen to best suit their use cases and market segment.
