## Welcome to Matt's Page

Hello everyone. I'm Matthew Hickey, a senior Computer Engineering student at Memorial University of Newfoundland (Class of '21). This page is the homepage to display any projects that I'm working on, feel free to take a look.

### Live Apps
* [Darts Scoreboard](https://mhickey.ca/darts-scoreboard-web)

### Projects

* [React Native Darts Scoreboard](https://github.com/matthickey709/darts-scoreboard-web). This scoreboard is the sequel to the original [Java Darts Scoreboard](https://github.com/matthickey709/DartsScoreboard), but written in React instead. It can currently score games of 501, 301, and Around the World, with more game modes coming soon.

* [uomi Android Application](https://github.com/hickeyjohnson/uomi_application) and [uomi REST API](https://github.com/hickeyjohnson/uomi_api). These projects were completed as part of my degree's junior design project alongside [Nathaniel Johnson](https://github.com/nathaniel19). It is an app where friends can track money owed either to each other, or as groups. The REST API was written with Flask, using Swagger as the documentation generator.
