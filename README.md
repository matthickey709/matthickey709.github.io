### Live Apps
* [Darts Scoreboard](https://mhickey.ca/darts-scoreboard-web)

### Projects/Work

* **IN PROGRESS [IoT Guitar Pedal](https://galaxysounds.ca)** _If you wish to see the source code for this project please reach out._ Capstone project for Computer Engineering. Created a multi-platform client app using Flutter that controls guitar pedal paramaters and effects. Backend created using AWS AppSync, DynamoDB, Cognito, and IoT Core.

* **IN PROGRESS Minecraft Settlement Generator**. Creating a Minecraft settlement generation AI that procedurally generates a Minecraft settlement that adapts to the existing environment. To be entered in the [2021 GDMC Competition](http://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu). _Source code available after submission_.

* **[React Native Darts Scoreboard](https://github.com/matthickey709/darts-scoreboard-web)**. This scoreboard is the sequel to the original [Java version](https://github.com/matthickey709/DartsScoreboard), but written in React instead. It can currently score games of 501, 301, and Around the World, with more (Baseball, Cricket) game modes coming soon.

* **[uomi Android Application](https://github.com/hickeyjohnson/uomi_application) and [uomi REST API](https://github.com/hickeyjohnson/uomi_api)**. These projects were completed as part of my degree's junior design project alongside [nathaniel19](https://github.com/nathaniel19). It is an app where friends can track money owed either to each other, or as groups. The REST API was written with Flask, using Swagger as the documentation generator. The database was Heroku hosted PostgreSQL.

* [**Report**: Computer Architecture of Wearable Technology](https://github.com/matthickey709/WearablesReport/blob/master/FullReport.pdf). This report was written as the final assignment for the Computer Architecture course of my engineering degree. It focuses on smartwatches and virtual reality headsets, and how their architecture was chosen to best suit their use cases and market segment.
